     Your brief tells you which one is yours. One of:
       'complement' 'analogous' 'triadic'
       'split-complement' 'warmer' 'luminance'          */

  /* ---- 3. HOW BIG IS IT? ---------------------------------
     How many neurons in the thinking layer.
     Fewer = faster, coarser, more obviously "a machine".
     More  = smoother, but harder to see what each neuron does.

  /* ---- 4. HOW DENSELY IS IT WIRED? -----------------------
     The chance that any given input neuron connects to any
     given hidden neuron. 1.0 would be all-to-all, like a
     computer. Real brains are far sparser than that.

  connectivity: 0.3,

  /* ---- 5. HOW MANY NEURONS FIRE AT ONCE? -----------------
     Only the loudest few neurons are allowed to fire; the rest
     are silenced by their neighbours. This is competition, and
     it is why one neuron cannot take over the whole brain.
     0.1 means the top 10% fire.

  /* ---- 5b. COLOUR vs BRIGHTNESS ---------------------------
     Your brain has two pathways, like your real visual system.
     This is the share of neurons on the COLOUR pathway; the rest
     watch brightness. 0.6 means 60% colour, 40% brightness.
     If your puzzle is about brightness, try lowering this.

  /* ---- 6. HOW FAST DOES IT LEARN? ------------------------
     How much a synapse strengthens each time two neurons fire
     together. Too low and it never learns. Too high and it
     panics and overwrites everything it knew.
     Try: 0.01, 0.05, 0.2                                     */
  learningRate: 0.05,

  /* ---- 7. DOES IT FORGET? --------------------------------
     How fast unused synapses fade away. 0 means it never
     forgets anything. Real synapses do fade — "use it or
     lose it".
     Try: 0, 0.001, 0.01                                      */

  /* ---- 8. STARTING WIRING --------------------------------
     Any whole number. Change it and your brain is born with a
     completely different random wiring — a different individual.
     Yours should be different from everyone else's.           */
